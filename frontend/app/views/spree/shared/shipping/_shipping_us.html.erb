<h5>*The use of multiple promos</h5>
<p>Currently it's only possible to take advantage of one promotion at a time, when you check out our system will automagically apply the promo that gives you the best deal so that you don't miss out.</p>
<h5>Shipping outside the US</h5>
<p>If you wish to ship your order to the EU, simply change the currency option (top right hand corner of our site) to £ or €. If a shipping offer is still available it will be advertised on the home page.</p>
<h5>Customs charges</h5>
<p>You may incur customs charges on orders over $200, if you are asked to pay customs then simply email <a href="mailto:info@woolandthegang.com">info@woolandthegang.com</a> with your receipt and we'll refund you the charge back.</p>
